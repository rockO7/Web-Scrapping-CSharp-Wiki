<think> Okay, the user wants to build a web scraper using Playwright for .NET that can be deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). They also want to ensure that the target website doesn't recognize it as a bot and block the IP. Let me break down the requirements.

First, I need to outline the key components. Using Playwright in .NET is straightforward, but deploying to AKS involves containerization. So, the code should be Dockerized. Then, avoiding detection: websites use various methods like checking user agents, request patterns, IP addresses, etc. To prevent blocking, the scraper needs to mimic human behavior, use realistic user agents, random delays, and possibly rotate IPs or use proxies.

The user might not have mentioned proxies, but IP blocking is a concern. So, including proxy support would be essential. However, setting up proxy rotation might be beyond the initial code, so maybe a placeholder for proxies. Also, headless browsers can be detected, so using stealth plugins like playwright-stealth might help, but I'm not sure if that's available in .NET. Alternatively, configuring Playwright settings to look more like a regular browser.

The code structure: a .NET console app with Playwright, Dockerfile for AKS deployment, and strategies to avoid detection. Need to include async operations, random delays between requests, user agent rotation, and maybe handling cookies. Also, error handling for robustness.

Deployment to AKS requires a Docker image. The Dockerfile should build the .NET app, install Playwright dependencies, and set up the environment. Then, Kubernetes deployment files (YAML) would be needed, but the user asked for .NET code, so maybe focus on the app and Dockerfile.

Testing the scraper to ensure it's not detected: check if the target site allows scraping in their terms, use legal and ethical considerations. But the user is probably aware, so focus on technical aspects.

Putting it all together: write a sample scraper with configurable options, use proxies if provided, random delays, user agent rotation, and headless mode with stealth settings if possible. Include Dockerfile example and note about AKS deployment steps. </think>

Here's a .NET solution using Playwright with anti-detection measures and deployment-ready configuration:

using Microsoft.Playwright;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace WebScraper
{
    class Program
    {
        private static readonly Random _random = new Random();
        private static readonly string[] _userAgents = new[]
        {
            "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36",
            "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.1 Safari/605.1.15",
            "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.114 Safari/537.36"
        };

        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
            await using var browser = await LaunchBrowser(playwright);
            var context = await CreateBrowserContext(browser);
            var page = await context.NewPageAsync();

            try
            {
                await ApplyHumanLikeBehavior(page);
                await page.GotoAsync("https://example.com");
                await RandomDelay(2000, 5000);
                
                // Your scraping logic here
                var content = await page.ContentAsync();
                Console.WriteLine(content);
            }
            finally
            {
                await browser.CloseAsync();
            }
        }

        private static async Task<IBrowser> LaunchBrowser(IPlaywright playwright)
        {
            return await playwright.Chromium.LaunchAsync(new BrowserTypeLaunchOptions
            {
                Headless = true,
                Args = new[] {
                    "--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled",
                    "--disable-infobars",
                    "--no-sandbox"
                }
            });
        }

        private static async Task<IBrowserContext> CreateBrowserContext(IBrowser browser)
        {
            var context = await browser.NewContextAsync(new BrowserNewContextOptions
            {
                UserAgent = _userAgents[_random.Next(_userAgents.Length)],
                ViewportSize = new ViewportSize
                {
                    Width = 1920,
                    Height = 1080
                },
                // Configure proxy if needed
                // Proxy = new Proxy { Server = "http://your-proxy:port" }
            });

            await context.AddCookiesAsync(GenerateCookies());
            return context;
        }

        private static List<Cookie> GenerateCookies()
        {
            return new List<Cookie>
            {
                new Cookie
                {
                    Name = "cookie_consent",
                    Value = "true",
                    Domain = "example.com",
                    Path = "/"
                }
            };
        }

        private static async Task ApplyHumanLikeBehavior(IPage page)
        {
            await page.EvaluateOnNewDocumentAsync(
                "() => Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'webdriver', { get: () => undefined })");
            
            await page.EvaluateOnNewDocumentAsync(
                "() => navigator.permissions.query = (parameters) => " +
                "(parameters.name === 'notifications' ? " +
                "Promise.resolve({ state: Notification.permission }) : originalQuery(parameters))");
        }

        private static async Task RandomDelay(int minMs, int maxMs)
        {
            await Task.Delay(_random.Next(minMs, maxMs));
        }
    }
}

Additional Recommendations:

Use IP rotation with proxy services like BrightData or Oxylabs
Implement request throttling
Randomize click positions and scroll patterns
Use distributed caching for cookies/sessions
Monitor response headers for anti-bot detection
Implement exponential backoff for retries
Add CAPTCHA solving service integration
Remember to:

Check website's robots.txt and terms of service
Respect rate limits
Add proper error handling
Implement health checks for AKS
Use Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
Add logging and monitoring
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the implementation?
